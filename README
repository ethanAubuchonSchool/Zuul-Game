2.0 Implementation:

2.1 Undo/Redo:

We chose to use an undo and redo stack to help implement the undo and redo methods.  Whenever a new command is entered, if it is a command that we have programmed to be "reversible" (a command we wish for the user to be able to undo), the command is pushed into the undo stack.  Whenever undo is called, the command is popped of the stack, inverted (pick becomes drop, attack becomes heal, go north becomes go south, ect), this reversed command is followed, and then stored into a redo stack.  If redo is called the command is popped out of the stack, reversed, followed, and stuck into the undo stack.  Whenever a reversable command is called, the redo stack is emptied.

2.2 Command words:

The command words have been broken into two categories: reversible and nonreversible.  The non-reversible commands are stored in a final static array of Strings.  The reversible commands are stored as keys in a hashmap, their reverse being stored as the value.  Only reversible commands can be undone.  If a command appears as its own reverse, then the code will go to a hashmap of second words and their reverse.  Currently, this rule only effect go and its directions.

Only reversible commands will be put into the undo/redo stacks, meaning undo and redo will only affect reversible commands.

The commands are as follows:

Reversible:
go - go
pick - drop
drop - pick
attack - heal
heal - attack

Non-reversible:
help
look
undo
redo
quit

2.3 Items and Monster

Items and monsters are stored in hashmaps.  Their string equivalent that the user inputs are the keys.  This makes it easy to return the proper monster or item to the Game class.

3.0 View

Instead of text-based view, player now will have GUI view showing the map and current room where the player are. 

The current room will be in the middle of the map and only the room that has been visited by the player will be shown in the map. 

The exits of the room will be shown to player so that player will know which exit is available.

4.0 Control

For now,player still will be using console input to control the game same as previous milestone.

5.0 Package

All the class have been rearranged into packages to follow MVC representation

Model:
	game.java
	Parser.java
	Room.Java
	
Model.command:
	Command.java
	CommandStack.java
	CommandWords.java
	
Model.object:
	Item.java
	Monster.java
	Player.java
	
view:
	DrawableRoom.java
	MapView.java

6.0 UML
	
The UML diagram is updated and added the new class for the GUI part (DrawableRoom.java and MapView.java) and rearranged into their package.

Sequence diagram for each command available for the player created.

List of sequence diagram:
play()
goRoom()
pick()
drop()
attack()
heal()
